            <strong>Safety Gear:</strong><br>

            Riders must wear approved safety gear, including a helmet, full leather suit, gloves, boots, and back protector.
            Safety gear should be in good condition and meet the track's safety standards.<br>
            <strong>Motorcycle Inspection:</strong><br>
            
            Motorcycles must undergo a pre-track inspection to ensure they are in good mechanical condition.
            Tires, brakes, lights, and other critical components should be inspected.<br>
            <strong>Rider Skill Levels:</strong><br>
            
            Trackdays often have different skill levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced/Pro).
            Riders are typically grouped based on their experience and skill level.<br>
            <strong>Briefings:</strong><br>
            
            Mandatory rider briefings are conducted to communicate track rules, safety guidelines, and any specific information about the event.
            Important information such as flag meanings and emergency procedures is usually covered.<br>
            <strong>Passing Rules:</strong><br>
            
            Clear rules for passing are established. This may include designated passing zones, no passing in certain corners, and the use of signals.
            Riders are expected to follow passing rules to prevent accidents.<br>
            <strong>Speed Limits in Pit Lane:</strong><br>
            
            There is often a strict speed limit in the pit lane to ensure the safety of riders and others in the pit area.<br>
            <strong>Noise Limits:</strong><br>
            
            Many tracks have noise restrictions, and riders must ensure their motorcycles meet the specified noise level requirements.<br>
            <strong>Behavior on Track:</strong><br>
            
            Reckless riding, aggressive behavior, and unsportsmanlike conduct are strictly prohibited.
            Riders are expected to be aware of their surroundings and ride responsibly.<br>
            <strong>Flag System:</strong><br>
            
            Familiarity with the flag system is essential. Different flags convey specific messages, such as caution, debris on the track, or an emergency situation.<br>
            <strong>Insurance and Liability:</strong><br>
            
            Riders may be required to have personal medical insurance, and the track may have liability waivers that participants must sign.<br>
            <strong>Bike Preparation:</strong><br>
            
            Bikes should be free of leaks, and the exhaust system must comply with track noise regulations.
            Remove or tape over mirrors and lights to prevent injury in case of a fall.<br>
            <strong>Alcohol and Substance Use:</strong><br>
            
            Riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs is strictly prohibited.
            These are general guidelines, and it's important for riders to review the specific rules and regulations of the particular trackday event they plan to attend. Track organizers usually provide a detailed list of requirements and guidelines for participants on their websites or during pre-event briefings.
